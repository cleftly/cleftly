# Music Library

## Organizing your music library

### Metadata

The best way to make sure your music library is properly organized is to simply add proper metadata to all of your files. There are several programs to help you achieve this, such as [MusicBrainz Picard](https://picard.musicbrainz.org/). We plan to add built-in metadata scanning in the future.

### Folder structure

If you do not wish to or are unable to add the proper metadata to your files, then you can use the following folder structure to store your music library.

```bash
- Artist
    - Album
        - Track
```

## Audio formats

### Recommended audio formats

For the best compatibility and encoding, we recommend using the following audio formats for your music library. These formats are supported on all platforms we officially support.

#### Lossless audio
